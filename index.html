                <h4>Formation and early years: 1992–1999</h4>
                <p> It was during his teenage years that Brock, who at the time was employed at the local family video store just outside Seattle, met bassist Eric Judy. Brock and Judy later ran into drummer Jeremiah Green,[3] who also resided near Seattle, at a heavy metal show and decided to make music together. In 1994, Modest Mouse recorded its first EP, Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?, at Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios. It was released by K Records. A single, "Broke", followed under Sub Pop that was recorded by Steve Wold (a.k.a. bluesman Seasick Steve) at Moon Studios in Olympia, Washington. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, Sad Sappy Sucker, but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before making their way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues. </p>
                <p> After moving to Up Records,[4] Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings recorded at Moon Studios, including the 1996 LP This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. This album was produced and recorded by Steve Wold (at the time Wold was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band). The next offering was Interstate 8, also produced by Wold. The 1997 album, The Lonesome Crowded West, (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) turned out to serve as the band's breakthrough. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following, and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock. During this time, Nick Kraft was brought in to refine the band's sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP The Fruit That Ate Itself. In 1999, Up Records released a singles and rarities collection entitled Building Nothing Out of Something that included the entirety of Interstate 8 except for the songs "Edit the Sad Parts" and "Buttons to Push the Buttons". </p>

            <div class="col-4 hidden" id="criticalSuccess" value="criticalSuccess">
                <h4>Critical success: 2000–2002</h4>
                <p> In 2000, Modest Mouse released The Moon &amp; Antarctica, its first album on Epic Records. The album, produced by Califone's Brian Deck during five months of sessions in Chicago, was critically acclaimed, which included a 9.8 out of 10 score from online music magazine, Pitchfork Media, despite people's concerns about releasing material on a major label. It has subsequently gone on to receive further acclaim. Brock has since released an album with his side project Ugly Casanova on Sub Pop, which was the only side project allowed due to the contract. The project supposedly began in 1998 after a fan, Edgar Graham, approached the band with some original songs. Graham, also known as Ugly Casanova, impressed Brock and the band offered to work with him. Graham, however, was never heard from again, but Brock decided to still continue the project with other musicians. Their debut album, Sharpen Your Teeth, was released in 2002. </p>
                <p> In 2001, Modest Mouse released the EP Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks, a collection of unused songs from the recording sessions of The Moon and Antarctica. In 2002, the band joined Cake, De La Soul, the Flaming Lips, the Hackensaw Boys and Kinky on the Unlimited Sunshine Tour. </p>

            <div class="col-4 hidden" id="mainstreamSuccess" value="mainstreamSuccess">
                <h4>Mainstream success, Johnny Marr joins the band: 2003–2009</h4>
                <p> In March 2003, Green left the band after suffering a nervous breakdown; the official word was that he was leaving to work with his side project, Vells. The same year, he and Judy appeared on Adam Forkner's first solo album, VVRSSNN. Green was replaced by two new members, drummer Benjamin Weikel (who also drummed for the Helio Sequence, as well as playing keyboard) and The Murder City Devils guitarist Dann Gallucci, who had been a member of Modest Mouse previously, and appears on Sad Sappy Sucker and The Lonesome Crowded West. Prior to starting the band’s writing and recording process, Brock was devastated by the loss of “a couple of the most important people in my life,” he said. This loss conjured a spectrum of emotion - hate, agony, shock - that was clearly evident in the band’s fourth album. Good News for People Who Love Bad News, which was released on April 6, 2004 and became certified Platinum the following August, had two hits with "Float On" and "Ocean Breathes Salty" (both of which they performed on Saturday Night Live on November 13, 2004). The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album that year, and "Float On" was nominated for Best Rock Song. Later that year, Green returned to the band and Weikel returned to drumming exclusively for the Helio Sequence. Gallucci left the band amicably in September of that year, with Jim Fairchild of Grandaddy and All Smiles following as his replacement. </p>
                <p> The public radio program Marketplace used "Float On" as bumper music and helped propel the group to a broader audience. </p>
                <p> In May 2006, Jim Fairchild was replaced on guitar by Johnny Marr, former guitarist for The Smiths. Modest Mouse's next album, We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, was released on March 20, 2007[13] after being delayed from December 19, 2006. The band’s fifth album also included bonus track and single "King Rat", which had caught the eye of a well-known actor before the track was even released; Brock was formally introduced to "The Dark Knight" star, Heath Ledger, while on their 2007 Australia tour. Ledger proposed an outline for a music video to the group, and immediately began working on it once he had the band’s approval. The video remained unfinished on account of Ledger's death in January 2008.[14]"We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank" was the first Modest Mouse album to reach No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 charts and had the hit single "Dashboard", as well as "Missed the Boat" and "We've Got Everything". Modest Mouse released singles for the songs "Satellite Skin", "Autumn Beds" and "Perpetual Motion Machine" in limited editions — a run of 4,000 each — vinyl 7 inches, featuring artwork by art director and illustrator Joshua Marc Levy, J.Alex Stamos, and Natasha Wheat. </p>
                <p> The band began a North American tour in June 2008. They returned to Florida for the first time since the November 2006 Bang Music Festival show, where they were cut off stage early, with three shows in Miami, Orlando and St. Augustine. Modest Mouse finished its tour supporting We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank after two years of promoting the record. </p>
                <p> Jim Fairchild reprised his role as guitarist when Marr left the band after joining The Cribs, beginning with the support of No One's First and You're Next, which was released on August 4, 2009,[16] composed of unreleased tracks from the recording sessions of Good News for People Who Love Bad News and We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank. </p>

                <h4>Touring, lineup changes, and re-releases: 2010–2014</h4>
                <p> In 2010, The Moon &amp; Antarctica was re-released on vinyl as part of Record Store Day. </p>
                <p> On July 4, 2010 the band headlined the second day of the 80/35 Music Festival in Des Moines, Iowa, and the first day of the End Of The Road Festival in Dorset, England, on September 10, 2010.[20] At the end of August 2010, Modest Mouse played on the main stage at the Leeds and Reading festivals. On April 28, 2011, Big Boi announced via Twitter that he had been in the studio with Modest Mouse working with them on their next album.[21] On May 29, Modest Mouse played two new songs during their headline of the Sasquatch festival. The songs were called "Poison the Well" and "Lampshades on Fire."[22] They then contributed a cover of the Buddy Holly song "That'll Be The Day" to the compilation Rave On Buddy Holly, which was released on June 28, 2011. Recently Modest Mouse had played at Splendour in the Grass in Woodford, Queensland on July 29, 2011,[23] The Warfield in San Francisco on January 25, 2012. </p>
                <p> In 2012, Modest Mouse underwent a significant lineup change, which included the departure of founding bassist Eric Judy and percussionist Joe Plummer, who were replaced by Russell Higbee and Davey Brozowski, respectively. The lineup also included the additions of multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Lisa Molinaro, and percussionist Ben Massarella, the latter of whom had previously played percussion on "The Moon &amp; Antarctica". </p>
                <p> Modest Mouse played a Saturday afternoon set at the inaugural Firefly Music Festival in July 2012. Modest Mouse was one of the main acts in the Good Vibes Festival held in Sepang, Malaysia on August 17, 2013. The lineup featured other internationally renowned bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Ash, and Japandroids.[25] In April 2013, Modest Mouse performed at Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California. They also performed at the 2014 Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama, in May 2014. They later performed as a headliner at Shaky Knees music festival in Atlanta, Georgia on May 10, 2014, and also headlined Sunday May 25 at Boston Calling in Massachusetts. Modest Mouse then performed at Hudson Valley Music Project in Saugerties, NY in July, 2014. The band's final performance in 2014 took place in Austin, Texas during Austin's annual Fun Fun Fun Fest. </p>

                <h4>Strangers to Ourselves: 2015–present</h4>
                <p> Eight years after the release of We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, Modest Mouse released Strangers to Ourselves on Tuesday, March 17, 2015. On December 13, 2014, the title and release date were confirmed to be in early 2015. Two days later, Modest Mouse released the lead single "Lampshades on Fire" which debuted on Twin Cities public radio station 89.3 The Current. On December 16, 2014, Modest Mouse made Strangers to Ourselves available for pre-order for CD and LP formats on the Glacial Pace website and on the iTunes store. Brock stated that the follow up to Strangers to Ourselves was currently in the making. It was said to be like a part two to Strangers to Ourselves and the release date is currently unknown, but Brock said they will try to release it as soon as legally possible. </p>

                <h4>Early life</h4>
                <p>Brock was born in Helena, Montana. During his childhood, he lived with his mother and sister in Montana and Oregon in hippie communes and churches before moving to Issaquah, Washington when he was 11 years old. Brock was home-schooled for part of his school career. When his mother's house flooded three times, she was forced to move into her future husband's trailer. Brock asked to stay behind in his own room until the new home was completed. He lived in the flooded home until the house was sold. After a short period of living in a friend's basement, he moved into the "Shed" built on the land next to his mother and stepfather's trailer.</p>
                <h4>Personal life</h4>
                <p>Although many of his songs use religious themes, Brock describes himself as "not really religious at all," adding "I'm 100 percent on the whole Christianity thing being a crock of shit, pretty much." He claims to "toy around with the whole Biblical thing," because it "just has amazing characters" and also identifies himself as "pretty much" an atheist. </p>
                <h4>Equipment</h4>
                <p>Brock's main guitars are custom made by Wicks Guitars.[13] Prior to his customs, Brock mainly used a Westone Corsair XA1420. He is also known to use various other guitars made by companies such as Peavey, Fender, and Gibson. His amps are custom made by Soursound, based on a Fender SuperSix, but are highly modified.</p>
